use system ticker,
change

bug fix in  usb::print(double)
math: 
sin(double) speed=4.762 us
do not try hardware floating x/, not speed increase

To avoid this C multiple definition error, define start in tree.c:
node_ptr start;
And then declare start as extern, so that other compilation units know about it but won't try and define it themselves, in your header file tree.h:

extern node_ptr start;
